This calculator was done as a project for my OOP course in college.
It can calculate equations with paranthesis that contains sums, substractions, multiplications, divizions,powers and roots of different order introduced from keyboard or read from a file.
The result can also be saved in a file. For invalid equations it shows an appropiate message.
The program can also be run from the command line.
The program uses multiple classes used for spell-checking, parsing and solving a single, simple equation.
It also uses an interface class. It's not a perfect calculator but it works in 98% of the times.
