This calculator was created as a project for my OOP course in college. It can calculate equations with parentheses that contain sums, subtractions, multiplications, divisions, powers, and roots of different orders introduced from the keyboard or read from a file. The result can also be saved in a file. For invalid equations, it shows an appropriate message. The program can also be run from the command line. It utilizes multiple classes for spell-checking, parsing, and solving a single, simple equation.
